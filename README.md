Hi, I’m @pushkarsathe89

I am interested in understanding how things work and using that to solve problems. My interests include A(G/S/?)I, Algorithms, Complex Systems, Vision, Materials, Astrobiology, Living sytems. Feel free to reach out if you share any of these interests or would like to work on something together!
